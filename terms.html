                            <h6>2. ACCOUNT BALANCES AND FEES.</h6>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">A. Account Balances.</span> Direct Supply may set a minimum balance that you must maintain on your Account (“Minimum”). Direct Supply reserves the right to increase or to decrease the Minimum on your Account immediately upon notice to you. Your Direct Supply Account must be funded at or above the Minimum in order to receive Direct Supply Services. The funds that you maintain in your Direct Supply Account constitute your “Account Balance”. As Direct Supply Services charges are incurred, Direct Supply will deduct these from your Account Balance. Direct Supply reserves the right to request deposits to receive Inventory to cover costs such as receiving costs and enforce minimum Account Balances. If your Account is closed for any reason, Direct Supply reserves the right to hold the Minimum Balance for up to 180 Days.</p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">B. Usage Fees. </span> “Usage Fees” are the fees for any Direct Supply Services and any third-party fees (including, but not limited to carrier fees, shipping fees, rates of duty, international brokerage charges, freight charges, or other charges given during your use of Direct Supply Services) ordered through your Account and any special or additional fees assessed against your Account as permitted in these Terms or the Policies. Note that the Usage Fees for Direct Supply Services are billed to the month in which the Direct Supply Services are performed. Usage Fees are subject to change. If you are on a billing plan, should you change plans during or at the end of any month, your previous pricing plan may no longer be available. </p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder"> C. Estimates. </span> Quotations for Direct Supply Services and Usage Fees are for informational purposes only and are subject to change without notice and shall not under any circumstances be binding upon Direct Supply. Quotations accepted through Direct Supply Services’ online interface are estimates based on the information available at the time made. The final rates and service fees may vary based upon the shipment actually tendered, the work actually performed, or a number of factors such as carrier shipping prices, the actual characteristics of your product, the delivery address, and services requested during the normal course of delivery. Direct Supply reserves the right to bill the Usage Fees based on actual charges at any time after the Direct Supply Services are rendered. Direct Supply specifically disclaims liability for any shipping rate errors due to inaccurate or incomplete information, such as dimensions and weights. </p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">D. Additional Item Fees/Credits. </span>  For some legacy Direct Supply plans, there may be a need to pay for additional item fees when the total items shipped during a month exceed plan allowance. Additional item fees are listed in the merchant Account, under Account plan preferences. Merchants on legacy Direct Supply pricing plans that use item allowances understand that plan items must be used during the specified billing period or will be automatically forfeited. This applies to items purchased as part of plan upgrades, as well as to any unused additional item credits. </p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">E. Currency Fluctuations.  </span> Direct Supply reserves the right to adjust its pricing in response to currency fluctuations, including but not limited to, currency conversion rate changes, conversion fee changes, and/or discount rate changes. </p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">F. Usage Fee Disputes. </span>  Should you disagree with any Usage Fees (other than carrier or third-party fees) charged against your Account, you must submit the dispute to Direct Supply within 90 days of the fee being charged (“Dispute Period”). Direct Supply will not review Customer requests for Usage Fee adjustments that are received after the Dispute Period. The dispute timing allowed for third-party fees and carrier fees shall be set by the applicable third-party or carrier and such time period may be substantially shorter than the Direct Supply Dispute Period. If you have a dispute with a third-party fee or carrier fee, please contact Direct Supply immediately. </p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">G. Account Balance Disputes. </span>   If Direct Supply becomes aware of, or is notified of, a dispute relating to your Account Balance, then Direct Supply will promptly review the dispute. Within 5 business days after the resolution of the dispute, Direct Supply will credit or debit your Account Balance accordingly, if appropriate. Direct Supply will not review Customer requests for Account Balance adjustments that are received more than 90 days after the amount in dispute is posted to your Account Balance. </p>
                            
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder"> H. Abandoned Account and Liquidation. </span> If your Usage Fees remain unpaid for a period greater than 30 days, then Direct Supply reserves the right, at its sole discretion to reclassify your Account as an “Abandoned Account.” Additionally, any Account that remains unpaid for greater than 60 days will automatically be deemed an Abandoned Account. Upon an Account becoming an Abandoned Account, all rights to ownership of the Account Balance and Inventory would then immediately be forfeited by you. Inventory will become immediately and irrevocably unavailable to you, and liquidation proceedings would begin. You agree the Inventory would be free and clear of liability, and that you would assume any liability therefore. You would have no rights to the liquidation proceeds. You would also remain liable for any pending Usage Fees above and beyond the liquidation proceeds. </p>
                            
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">I. Taxes. </span>  You acknowledge and agree that all fees, charges and any other rates or amounts charged by Direct Supply to you hereunder are exclusive of applicable value added, sales/use or Inventory and service taxes (“Transaction Taxes”) which may be levied in connection with the supply by Direct Supply of the Direct Supply Services to you. Where applicable, you shall pay all Transaction Taxes arising in respect of the Usage Fees or other amounts charged by Direct Supply to you. </p>

                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">K. Payment and Discounts. </span>  
                                <ol>

                                    <li>Discounts (Carrier Discount). Carrier rates are subject to change, whenever there is a change in rates by the carrier, or any increases in charges or costs in the provision of the services to Direct Supply outside of its control or if there is a fluctuation in foreign exchange rates. Rates may be subject to carrier rate increases assessed by carriers. For sake of clarity the percentage (%) off offered is off the published transportation rates prior to surcharges and taxes. All discounts are off transportation charge only, other charges such as ancillary charges, surcharges, brokerage, duties or insurance do not qualify for any discounts. You may see a different amount displayed on the Direct Supply interface to convert to this amount due to Direct Supply shipping system.</li>

For purposes of these Terms and subject to the Exclusions set forth below, Confidential Information means any information provided to it by the other party (“Discloser”) that is marked, labeled or otherwise designated as confidential or proprietary, or that Recipient knew, or should have known, was confidential due to the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.</p>

                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder"> C. Termination with 30 days notice.</span>  Direct Supply reserves the right to terminate an Account for any reason upon 30 days notice (“Termination Notice Period”) which Direct Supply shall send to you via email. It is your responsibility to make sure Direct Supply has a working email for you. You may have full or limited use of your Account during the Termination Notice Period in our discretion, with the intention of allowing you to expire existing inventory without it being shipped back to you. Any Inventory that remains in Inventory at the expiration of the Termination Notice Period will be shipped to the address on file and, if address is not on file, the billing address on your credit card, at your expense. If no address is available or no balance is available to pay for shipment back to you, we will liquidate your remaining Inventory. (See Abandoned Account and Liquidation Policy for more information.) </p>
                            <p><span style="font-weight:bolder">D. Payment for Services prior to Inventory Removal.</span>   Prior to Merchant removing all Inventory following termination or expiration, Merchant shall pay Direct Supply i) all current amounts outstanding for Service fees, transportation, storage and other fees and ii) a good faith estimate of amounts that will become due for transportation, storage and Service and other fees that will be incurred prior to the termination date.</p>
